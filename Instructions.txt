<<<<< Instructions for compiling EASyCF51 >>>>>

EASyCF51 was created using Borland C++ Builder 6.0 Professional. Builder 6 is no longer available for purchase new but used copies are fairly easy to find.

There are project files included for the Editor/Assembler and the Simulator, EDITCF51.BPR and SIMCF51.BPR.

To compile EDITCF51:
Add the new RichEditPlus control to Builder. See "Installation Instructions.txt" in the RichEditPlus folder in EditCF51 source.


To compile SIMCF51:

Get the DirectX8 .h files from the Microsoft DirectX SDK. Place them in a folder named DirectX and put the DirectX folder in C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder6\Include. 

Place dsound.lib in C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder6\Lib
dsound.lib is from: http://realmike.org/borlibs/index.htm
